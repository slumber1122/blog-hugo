## blockchain

A blockchain is a distributed computing architecture where every network node executes and records the same transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Only one block can be added at a time, and every block contains a mathematical proof that verifies that it follows in sequence from the previous block.

The Ethereum blockchain database is maintained and updated by many nodes connected to the network.
